Deep Learning Model Performance Report: Alphabet Soup
**Analysis Overview**
The purpose of this analysis is to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model designed for the Alphabet Soup dataset. The model's effectiveness is assessed based on its ability to classify outcomes accurately.

**Results**
**Data Preprocessing**
**What is the target variable in the model?**

The target variable is "IS_SUCCESSFUL" from the application_df dataset.

**Which variables serve as features in the model?**

All columns in application_df except "IS_SUCCESSFUL" were used as features.

**Which variables were removed from the dataset and why?**
The "EIN" and "NAME" columns were excluded since they do not contribute to predicting the target outcome.

**Model Compilation, Training, and Evaluation**
**How many neurons, layers, and activation functions were used in the model, and why?**

Initially, the model was built with 8 neurons in the first hidden layer and 5 neurons in the second hidden layer. These values were chosen as a starting point for further optimization.

**Did the model achieve the target performance?**

No, the model did not meet the desired 75% accuracy threshold, falling slightly short.

**What strategies were implemented to improve performance?**

Several adjustments were made, including:

Adding more layers.

Removing additional columns.

Increasing the number of hidden nodes.

Experimenting with different activation functions for each layer.

**Summary and Recommendations**
The final model achieved an accuracy of approximately 73%, which, while close, did not meet the target performance goal. To enhance classification accuracy, future models could:

Perform more rigorous data preprocessing to improve the correlation between input features and output labels.

Experiment with different activation functions to optimize network performance.

Continue iterating on the modelâ€™s architecture, adjusting layers and neurons to refine accuracy.

A different machine learning model, such as a Random Forest classifier or Gradient Boosting model, might provide better performance by capturing complex relationships in the dataset more effectively.
